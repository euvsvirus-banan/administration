# Checkpoint 1

## Project Definition

### Problem statement

During a crisis mobility can be severely reduced or limited. This can be due to security concerns, inability to do so due to damaged infrastructure or to limit the spread of pathogens like COVID19

As communities become isolated it is important they become as self-sufficient as possible as help and/or resources from outside the community may be limited.

### Proposed Solution

The solution centers around building a social network centered around geographical areas. These geographical areas could be defined by distance and/or reachability in case of reduced mobility due to security reasons or damaged infrastructure or be limited to fixed geographies in case communities need to be isolated (i.e. a postcode area, a county, etc.)


This social network would provide a number of services to the local community:

1. Ability to offer help, services and produce, both commercially and altruistically.
2. Ability to request help; from requests by vulnerable people to perform daily chores to requests to bring communities together to fix machinery or infrastructure that could further help the community.

In addition, the platform would offer a global network centered around knowledge, skills and topics to share ideas and help each other out. This could foster innovation as communities collaborate each other to solve problems with limited resources. In addition, experts around the globe would be able to help isolated communities solve problems for which they don't have the skills for.

### Impact

By supporting communities to become self-sufficient we can greatly reduce their exposure to danger during crisis. In the case of a pandemic, isolating communities may be necessary to reduce the chances of spreading diseases between different communities. In addition, by focusing on the community we aim at bringing communities together to ensure their survival as a group and to help individuals in times of need.


### Future work

This platform could be used under regular circumstances as well. Local communities could use this network to discover local services, find local produce or even to exchange skills. In order to exchange skills a simple credit system could be added where someone provides help for N hours providing a service and in exchange get N credits that in turn can be used to get help by someone else (i.e. someone helps a neighbor fixing their wifi getting N credits and using those credits to get help fixing the yard). This could strengthen communities and boost local economies.


In addition, this global network of knowledge could be used by communities like [makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) anytime to interact with peers around the globe, exchange ideas, collaborate, etc.

## Plan

### MVP

During the hackathon we will focus on building the part that allows local communities interact with each other to offer and request services and/or help.
